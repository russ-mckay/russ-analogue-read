There are a number of library files required which can be loaded with pip install

Note that the version of Python used is 3.6.7
The Spot SDK is not required for this script if the images are already stored locally

This script can be used with images collected from Spot Cam cameras. 
It is important to get close to the image and have good lighting. Shadows and low level lighting will affect the performance (i.e. the system will fail!)

I have added some imasge files in thie repo.
